## Issues to fix:

+ Something is wrong with the logo. We added styles in the CSS file for it to be a certain width, but in the browser it isn't smaller. Can you fix it?<!--I think I did this correctly, it was my understanding that the logo should be the same size set in the styles on all displays rather than changing from desktop to mobile-->
